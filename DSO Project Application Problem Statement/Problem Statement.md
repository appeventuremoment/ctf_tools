Performing targeted sentiment analysis in meme images.

Given the viral nature of memes, it is easily consumable and an effective method for disseminating information and ideas. Often times, some of the understanding is not so straight-forward and highly implicit in nature, requiring multiple layers of understanding and relevant contextual knowledge.


Based on the following 2 sample meme images relating to the Singapore-context:

Explain how you would build an AI framework to 
1) Identify the target in the meme (Person, Organisation, Country, Race, Religion etc.) 
2) Predict and classify the sentiments towards the identified target (Positive, Negative or Neutral).


In your plan:
- Include details on your workflow (You may draw up a pipeline diagram to illustrate how your envisaged system will work), identifying the various inputs and outputs in the modelling approach.
- Include names of techniques that you will be using i.e. Face Recognition with FaceNet/InsightFace model, 3-class classification with Support Vector Machines using Scikit-Learn package etc.
- A short write-up on your thought-process, ideation or methodology on why you think this would work.

In your research, you may google various sources for inspiration and ideas. You are free to make any assumptions, but you would be required to state them up front. You are encouraged to be as detailed as possible given the limited timeframe assigned to you. Abstracted information, and generic statements such as "Using a machine learning model to detect objects" are not encouraged as it does not provide knowledge on your thinking framework. Similarly, we do not expect a long and extensive literature review, with multiple paper citations. Limit your plan to no more than a 2-page word document if possible.
