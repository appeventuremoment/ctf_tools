OSINT Challenge

From what I can remember they asked for the coordinates of this location.

The intended solution was to use google images or any tools of that sort to recognise the Chinese text, and from there, correcting any characters that may have been recognised wrongly and searching it on google. 

Searching the vertical line of text should lead to a pharmacy or clinic (can't remember) where there is only one instance of. From there, get the coordinates and that is the flag.
