Cryptography Challenge

Usual caeser cipher, except they took each letter, broke their ascii code in binary into 2 parts and got the corresponding letter in the first 16 characters of the alphabet, before doing the caeser shift.

Simply undo the shift using brute force and undo the decoding. 

Flag is et_tu?_1ac5f3d7920a85610afeb2572831daa8. Had troubles finding it in the wall of text, especially it not being in English. Overall really simple challenge, just remember that you are using 16 letters and not to test with the full range of characters.
