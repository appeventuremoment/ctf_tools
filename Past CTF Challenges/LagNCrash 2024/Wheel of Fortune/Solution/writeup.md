Misc Challenge

You are given a txt files with a long nested list, with each sub-list consisting of 3 values. Looking closely, you realise they are between 0-255. RGB.

Convert the txt files to a png by converting each list to a pixel. The output is rotated so putting it through an online tool, we are able to see that a pastebin link is given. However, we do not know the capitalisation of the UUID, as well as the last character.

Create every possible combination for UUIDs and use webscraping to check whether any of them are valid. Print the valid URLs and obtain the flag.
