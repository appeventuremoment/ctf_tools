You know this challenge was really funny personally. Since the challenge said they encrypted it using a potato, I looked for potato ciphers, hashes or even encryption methods and stumbled upon https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/10888-potato-ransomware. Naturally I read up and thought that it was a file encrypted using this ransomware so I had to use AES-256 to decrypt it, and the website's application claims to be able to decrypt it.

However, after a hint from the organisers that there are tools online to identify what hash it is, I realised that I overthought. I overcooked and burnt down the kitchen. I am literally Sukuna after frying his brains fighting Gojo, with that Domain Expansion: Malfunctioning Kitchen and all that.

It's just a SHA1 hash. It says pandas.

The flag is ACSI{pandas}
